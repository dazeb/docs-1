            <summary>Will there be a way to migrate from Pterodactyl to Pelican?</summary>

            <summary>Will Blueprint extensions work on Pelican?</summary>

            [Blueprint](https://blueprint.zip) is **not** planning on adding compatibility for extensions to Pelican and will stick with Pterodactyl.

            "My vision with Blueprint does not align with Pelican's. Blueprint also currently does not have the manpower to maintain compatibility towards multiple forks of Pterodactyl at the same time, especially with the namespace changes."

            "Blueprint is meant to be an open-source standardization for Pterodactyl modifications that lives under the MIT license. Blueprint extensions work by utilizing handpicked extension APIs, which can't all make it into Pelican, nor will be easy to maintain for Pelican in the future. The framework is meant to be open towards anyone, and not involve one central provider for extension distribution. We would love to see what Pelican has in store for their community and their project, but it isn't something we can support nor maintain compatibility for."
